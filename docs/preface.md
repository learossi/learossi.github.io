# Preface {-}

Hey all! These are a few portfolio projects I've done that are relatively quick reads just to show off what I know/can do. Here's a quick guide the all the projects which you can navigate to using the sidebar:

* Campaign Finance: An attempt to estimate the effect that money raised by candidates has on campaign outcomes independent of candidate popularity or affability. 
* Electricity Demand: A comparison of commonly recommended neural network structures for predicting short-term domestic electricity demand. 
* Seed Market Competition: My bachelors thesis in economics which analyzes the historical effect of increasing concentration in the seed market on farmer's outcomes. 
* Chicago Taxi Market: Forecasting demand in the Chicago Taxi market using a variety of time-series methods.
